;; This test contains two components, $Producer and $Consumer.
;; $Producer.run drives the test and calls $Producer.start-stream to create
;; a stream and attempt to write 2 owned handles. $Producer.run then reads
;; just 1 element. The test finishes by confirming that $Consumer owns the
;; first resource, $Producer (still) owns the second resource, and $Producer
;; traps if it attempts to access the index of the first resource.
