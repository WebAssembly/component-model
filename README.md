# Component Model design and specification

This repository describes the high-level [goals], [use cases], [design choices]
and [FAQ] of the component model as well as a more-detailed [explainer],
[binary format] and [ABI] covering the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
release.

In the future, this repository will additionally contain a [formal spec],
reference interpreter and test suite.
