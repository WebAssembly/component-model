\section{Conventions}

As in Core WebAssembly, a \emph{validation} stage checks that a
component is well-formed, and only valid components may be
instantiated.

Similarly to Core WebAssembly, a \emph{type system} over the abstract
syntax of a component is used to specify which modules are valid, and
the rules governing the validity of a component are given in both
prose and formal mathematical notation.

\subsection{Notation}

Both the formal and prose notation share a number of constructs:

\begin{itemize}
\item When writing a value of the abstract syntax, any component of
  the abstract syntax which has the form $\X{nonterminal}^n$,
  $\X{nonterminal}^\ast$, $\X{nonterminal}^{+}$, or
  $\X{nonterminal}^{?}$, we may write $\overline{\dots_i}^n$ to mean
  that this position is filled by a series of $n$ abstract values,
  named $\dots_1$ to $\dots_n$.
\end{itemize}
