## Supporting definitions

The Canonical ABI specifies, for each component function signature, a
corresponding core function signature and the process for reading
component-level values into and out of linear memory. While a full formal
specification would specify the Canonical ABI in terms of macro-expansion into
Core WebAssembly instructions augmented with a new set of (spec-internal)
[administrative instructions], the informal presentation here instead specifies
the process in terms of Python code that would be logically executed at
validation- and run-time by a component model implementation. The Python code
is presented by interleaving definitions with descriptions and eliding some
boilerplate. For a complete listing of all Python definitions in a single
executable file with a small unit test suite, see the
[`canonical-abi`](canonical-abi/) directory.

The convention followed by the Python code below is that all traps are raised
by explicit `trap()`/`trap_if()` calls; Python `assert()` statements should
never fire and are only included as hints to the reader. Similarly, there
should be no uncaught Python exceptions.

While the Python code appears to perform a copy as part of lifting
the contents of linear memory into high-level Python values, a normal
implementation should never need to make this extra intermediate copy.
This claim is expanded upon [below](#calling-into-a-component).

Lastly, independently of Python, the Canonical ABI defined below assumes that
out-of-memory conditions (such as `memory.grow` returning `-1` from within
`realloc`) will trap (via `unreachable`). This significantly simplifies the
Canonical ABI by avoiding the need to support the complicated protocols
necessary to support recovery in the middle of nested allocations. In the MVP,
for large allocations that can OOM, [streams](Explainer.md#TODO) would usually
be the appropriate type to use and streams will be able to explicitly express
failure in their type. Post-MVP, [adapter functions] would allow fully custom
OOM handling for all component-level types, allowing a toolchain to
intentionally propagate OOM into the appropriate explicit return value of the
function's declared return type.


### Despecialization

[In the explainer][Type Definitions], component value types are classified as
either *fundamental* or *specialized*, where the specialized value types are
defined by expansion into fundamental value types. In most cases, the canonical
ABI of a specialized value type is the same as its expansion so, to avoid
repetition, the other definitions below use the following `despecialize`
function to replace specialized value types with their expansion:
```python
def despecialize(t):
  match t:
    case Tuple(ts)         : return Record([ Field(str(i), t) for i,t in enumerate(ts) ])
    case Enum(labels)      : return Variant([ Case(l, None) for l in labels ])
    case Option(t)         : return Variant([ Case("none", None), Case("some", t) ])
    case Result(ok, error) : return Variant([ Case("ok", ok), Case("error", error) ])
    case _                 : return t
```
The specialized value types `string` and `flags` are missing from this list
because they are given specialized canonical ABI representations distinct from
their respective expansions.


### Alignment

Each value type is assigned an [alignment] which is used by subsequent
Canonical ABI definitions. Presenting the definition of `alignment` piecewise,
we start with the top-level case analysis:
```python
def alignment(t):
  match despecialize(t):
    case Bool()             : return 1
    case S8() | U8()        : return 1
    case S16() | U16()      : return 2
    case S32() | U32()      : return 4
    case S64() | U64()      : return 8
    case F32()              : return 4
    case F64()              : return 8
    case Char()             : return 4
    case String() | List(_) : return 4
    case Record(fields)     : return alignment_record(fields)
    case Variant(cases)     : return alignment_variant(cases)
    case Flags(labels)      : return alignment_flags(labels)
    case Own(_) | Borrow(_) : return 4
```

Record alignment is tuple alignment, with the definitions split for reuse below:
```python
def alignment_record(fields):
  a = 1
  for f in fields:
    a = max(a, alignment(f.t))
  return a
```

As an optimization, `variant` discriminants are represented by the smallest integer
covering the number of cases in the variant (with cases numbered in order from
`0` to `len(cases)-1`). Depending on the payload type, this can allow more
compact representations of variants in memory. This smallest integer type is
selected by the following function, used above and below:
```python
def alignment_variant(cases):
  return max(alignment(discriminant_type(cases)), max_case_alignment(cases))

def discriminant_type(cases):
  n = len(cases)
  assert(0 < n < (1 << 32))
  match math.ceil(math.log2(n)/8):
    case 0: return U8()
    case 1: return U8()
    case 2: return U16()
    case 3: return U32()

def max_case_alignment(cases):
  a = 1
  for c in cases:
    if c.t is not None:
      a = max(a, alignment(c.t))
  return a
```

As an optimization, `flags` are represented as packed bit-vectors. Like variant
discriminants, `flags` use the smallest integer that fits all the bits, falling
back to sequences of `i32`s when there are more than 32 flags.
```python
def alignment_flags(labels):
  n = len(labels)
  if n <= 8: return 1
  if n <= 16: return 2
  return 4
```

Handle types are passed as `i32` indices into the `Table[HandleElem]`
introduced below.


### Element Size

Each value type is also assigned an `elem_size` which is the number of bytes
used when values of the type are stored as elements of a `list`. Having this
byte size be a static property of the type instead of attempting to use a
variable-length element-encoding scheme both simplifies the implementation and
maps well to languages which represent `list`s as random-access arrays. Empty
types, such as records with no fields, are not permitted, to avoid
complications in source languages.
```python
def elem_size(t):
  match despecialize(t):
    case Bool()             : return 1
    case S8() | U8()        : return 1
    case S16() | U16()      : return 2
    case S32() | U32()      : return 4
    case S64() | U64()      : return 8
    case F32()              : return 4
    case F64()              : return 8
    case Char()             : return 4
    case String() | List(_) : return 8
    case Record(fields)     : return elem_size_record(fields)
    case Variant(cases)     : return elem_size_variant(cases)
    case Flags(labels)      : return elem_size_flags(labels)
    case Own(_) | Borrow(_) : return 4

def elem_size_record(fields):
  s = 0
  for f in fields:
    s = align_to(s, alignment(f.t))
    s += elem_size(f.t)
  assert(s > 0)
  return align_to(s, alignment_record(fields))

def align_to(ptr, alignment):
  return math.ceil(ptr / alignment) * alignment

def elem_size_variant(cases):
  s = elem_size(discriminant_type(cases))
  s = align_to(s, max_case_alignment(cases))
  cs = 0
  for c in cases:
    if c.t is not None:
      cs = max(cs, elem_size(c.t))
  s += cs
  return align_to(s, alignment_variant(cases))

def elem_size_flags(labels):
  n = len(labels)
  assert(n > 0)
  if n <= 8: return 1
  if n <= 16: return 2
  return 4 * num_i32_flags(labels)

def num_i32_flags(labels):
  return math.ceil(len(labels) / 32)
```

### Runtime State

The subsequent definitions of loading and storing a value from linear memory
require additional runtime state, which is threaded through most subsequent
definitions via the `cx` parameter of type `CallContext`:
```python
@dataclass
class CallContext:
  opts: CanonicalOptions
  inst: ComponentInstance
```

The `opts` field of `CallContext` contains all the possible `canonopt`
immediates that can be passed to the `canon` definition being implemented.
```python
@dataclass
class CanonicalOptions:
  memory: Optional[bytearray] = None
  string_encoding: Optional[str] = None
  realloc: Optional[Callable] = None
  post_return: Optional[Callable] = None
```

The `inst` field of `CallContext` points to the component instance which the
`canon`-generated function is closed over. Component instances contain all the
core wasm instance as well as some extra state that is used exclusively by the
Canonical ABI:
```python
class ComponentInstance:
  # core module instance state
  may_leave: bool
  may_enter: bool
  handles: HandleTables

  def __init__(self):
    self.may_leave = True
    self.may_enter = True
    self.handles = HandleTables()
```
The `may_enter` and `may_leave` fields are used to enforce the [component
invariants]: `may_leave` indicates whether the instance may call out to an
import and the `may_enter` state indicates whether the instance may be called
from the outside world through an export.

The `handles` field of `ComponentInstance` contains a mapping from
`ResourceType` to `Table`s of `HandleElem`s (defined next), establishing a
separate `i32`-indexed array per resource type.
```python
class HandleTables:
  rt_to_table: MutableMapping[ResourceType, Table[HandleElem]]

  def __init__(self):
    self.rt_to_table = dict()

  def table(self, rt):
    if rt not in self.rt_to_table:
      self.rt_to_table[rt] = Table[HandleElem]()
    return self.rt_to_table[rt]

  def get(self, rt, i):
    return self.table(rt).get(i)
  def add(self, rt, h):
    return self.table(rt).add(h)
  def remove(self, rt, i):
    return self.table(rt).remove(i)
```
While this Python code performs a dynamic hash-table lookup on each handle
table access, as we'll see below, the `rt` parameter is always statically known
such that a normal implementation can statically enumerate all `Table` objects
at compile time and then route the calls to `get`, `add` and `remove` to the
correct `Table` at the callsite. The net result is that each component instance
will contain one handle table per resource type used by the component, with
each compiled adapter function accessing the correct handle table as-if it were
a global variable.

The `ResourceType` class represents a concrete resource type that has been
created by the component instance `impl`. `ResourceType` objects are used as
keys by `HandleTables` above and thus we assume that Python object identity
corresponds to resource type equality, as defined by [type checking] rules.
```python
class ResourceType(Type):
  impl: ComponentInstance
  dtor: Optional[Callable]

  def __init__(self, impl, dtor = None):
    self.impl = impl
    self.dtor = dtor
```
The `Table` class, used by `HandleTables` above, encapsulates a single
mutable, growable array of generic elements, indexed by Core WebAssembly
`i32`s.
```python
ElemT = TypeVar('ElemT')
class Table(Generic[ElemT]):
  array: list[Optional[ElemT]]
  free: list[int]

  def __init__(self):
    self.array = [None]
    self.free = []

  def get(self, i):
    trap_if(i >= len(self.array))
    trap_if(self.array[i] is None)
    return self.array[i]

  def add(self, e):
    if self.free:
      i = self.free.pop()
      assert(self.array[i] is None)
      self.array[i] = e
    else:
      i = len(self.array)
      trap_if(i >= 2**30)
      self.array.append(e)
    return i

  def remove(self, i):
    e = self.get(i)
    self.array[i] = None
    self.free.append(i)
    return e
```
`Table` maintains a dense array of elements that can contain holes created by
the `remove` method (defined below). When table elements are accessed (e.g., by
`canon_lift` and `resource.rep`, below), there are thus both a bounds check and
hole check necessary. Upon initialization, table element `0` is allocated and
set to `None`, effectively reserving index `0` which is both useful for
catching null/uninitialized accesses and allowing `0` to serve as a sentinel
value.

The `add` and `remove` methods work together to maintain a free list of holes
that are used in preference to growing the table. The free list is represented
as a Python list here, but an optimizing implementation could instead store the
free list in the free elements of `array`.

The limit of `2**30` ensures that the high 2 bits of table indices are unset
and available for other use in guest code (e.g., for tagging, packed words or
sentinel values).

The `HandleElem` class defines the elements of the per-resource-type `Table`s
stored in `HandleTables`:
```python
class HandleElem:
  rep: int
  own: bool
  scope: Optional[ExportCall]
  lend_count: int

  def __init__(self, rep, own, scope = None):
    self.rep = rep
    self.own = own
    self.scope = scope
    self.lend_count = 0
```
The `rep` field of `HandleElem` stores the resource representation (currently
fixed to be an `i32`) passed to `resource.new`.

The `own` field indicates whether this element was created from an `own` type
(or, if false, a `borrow` type).

The `scope` field stores the `ExportCall` that created the borrowed handle.
Until async is added to the Component Model, because of the non-reentrancy of
components, there is at most one `ExportCall` alive for a given component at a
time and thus this field does not actually need to be stored per `HandleElem`.

The `lend_count` field maintains a conservative approximation of the number of
live handles that were lent from this `own` handle (by calls to `borrow`-taking
functions). This count is maintained by the `ImportCall` bookkeeping functions
(above) and is ensured to be zero when an `own` handle is dropped.

An optimizing implementation can enumerate the canonical definitions present
in a component to statically determine that a given resource type's handle
table only contains `own` or `borrow` handles and then, based on this,
statically eliminate the `own` and the `lend_count` xor `scope` fields,
and guards thereof.

One `CallContext` is created for each call for both the component caller and
callee (in `canon_lower` and `canon_lift`, resp., as defined below). Thus, a
cross-component call will create 2 `CallContext` objects for the call, while a
component-to-host or host-to-component call will create a single `CallContext`
for the component caller or callee, resp.

Additional per-call state is required to check that callers and callees uphold
their respective parts of the call contract:

The `ExportCall` subclass of `CallContext` tracks the number of borrowed
handles that were passed as parameters to the export that have not yet been
dropped (which might dangle if the caller destroys the resource after the
call):
```python
class ExportCall(CallContext):
  borrow_count: int

  def __init__(self, opts, inst):
    super().__init__(opts, inst)
    self.borrow_count = 0

  def create_borrow(self):
    self.borrow_count += 1

  def drop_borrow(self):
    assert(self.borrow_count > 0)
    self.borrow_count -= 1

  def exit(self):
    trap_if(self.borrow_count != 0)
```

The `ImportCall` subclass of `CallContext` tracks the owned handles that have
been lent for the duration of an import call, ensuring that they aren't dropped
during the call (which might create a dangling borrowed handle):
```python
class ImportCall(CallContext):
  lenders: list[HandleElem]

  def __init__(self, opts, inst):
    super().__init__(opts, inst)
    self.lenders = []

  def track_owning_lend(self, lending_handle):
    assert(lending_handle.own)
    lending_handle.lend_count += 1
    self.lenders.append(lending_handle)

  def exit(self):
    for h in self.lenders:
      h.lend_count -= 1
```
Note, the `lenders` list usually has a fixed size (in all cases except when a
function signature has `borrow`s in `list`s) and thus can be stored inline in
the native stack frame.


### Loading

The `load` function defines how to read a value of a given value type `t`
out of linear memory starting at offset `ptr`, returning the value represented
as a Python value. Presenting the definition of `load` piecewise, we start with
the top-level case analysis:
```python
def load(cx, ptr, t):
  assert(ptr == align_to(ptr, alignment(t)))
  assert(ptr + elem_size(t) <= len(cx.opts.memory))
  match despecialize(t):
    case Bool()         : return convert_int_to_bool(load_int(cx, ptr, 1))
    case U8()           : return load_int(cx, ptr, 1)
    case U16()          : return load_int(cx, ptr, 2)
    case U32()          : return load_int(cx, ptr, 4)
    case U64()          : return load_int(cx, ptr, 8)
    case S8()           : return load_int(cx, ptr, 1, signed=True)
    case S16()          : return load_int(cx, ptr, 2, signed=True)
    case S32()          : return load_int(cx, ptr, 4, signed=True)
    case S64()          : return load_int(cx, ptr, 8, signed=True)
    case F32()          : return decode_i32_as_float(load_int(cx, ptr, 4))
    case F64()          : return decode_i64_as_float(load_int(cx, ptr, 8))
    case Char()         : return convert_i32_to_char(cx, load_int(cx, ptr, 4))
    case String()       : return load_string(cx, ptr)
    case List(t)        : return load_list(cx, ptr, t)
    case Record(fields) : return load_record(cx, ptr, fields)
    case Variant(cases) : return load_variant(cx, ptr, cases)
    case Flags(labels)  : return load_flags(cx, ptr, labels)
    case Own()          : return lift_own(cx, load_int(cx, ptr, 4), t)
    case Borrow()       : return lift_borrow(cx, load_int(cx, ptr, 4), t)
```

Integers are loaded directly from memory, with their high-order bit interpreted
according to the signedness of the type.
```python
def load_int(cx, ptr, nbytes, signed = False):
  return int.from_bytes(cx.opts.memory[ptr : ptr+nbytes], 'little', signed=signed)
```

Integer-to-boolean conversions treats `0` as `false` and all other bit-patterns
as `true`:
```python
def convert_int_to_bool(i):
  assert(i >= 0)
  return bool(i)
```

Floats are loaded directly from memory, with the sign and payload information
of NaN values discarded. Consequently, there is only one unique NaN value per
floating-point type. This reflects the practical reality that some languages
and protocols do not preserve these bits. In the Python code below, this is
expressed as canonicalizing NaNs to a particular bit pattern.

See the comments about lowering of float values for a discussion of possible
optimizations.
```python
DETERMINISTIC_PROFILE = False # or True
CANONICAL_FLOAT32_NAN = 0x7fc00000
CANONICAL_FLOAT64_NAN = 0x7ff8000000000000

def canonicalize_nan32(f):
  if math.isnan(f):
    f = core_f32_reinterpret_i32(CANONICAL_FLOAT32_NAN)
    assert(math.isnan(f))
  return f

def canonicalize_nan64(f):
  if math.isnan(f):
    f = core_f64_reinterpret_i64(CANONICAL_FLOAT64_NAN)
    assert(math.isnan(f))
  return f

def decode_i32_as_float(i):
  return canonicalize_nan32(core_f32_reinterpret_i32(i))

def decode_i64_as_float(i):
  return canonicalize_nan64(core_f64_reinterpret_i64(i))

def core_f32_reinterpret_i32(i):
  return struct.unpack('<f', struct.pack('<I', i))[0] # f32.reinterpret_i32

def core_f64_reinterpret_i64(i):
  return struct.unpack('<d', struct.pack('<Q', i))[0] # f64.reinterpret_i64
```

An `i32` is converted to a `char` (a [Unicode Scalar Value]) by dynamically
testing that its unsigned integral value is in the valid [Unicode Code Point]
range and not a [Surrogate]:
```python
def convert_i32_to_char(cx, i):
  assert(i >= 0)
  trap_if(i >= 0x110000)
  trap_if(0xD800 <= i <= 0xDFFF)
  return chr(i)
```

Strings are loaded from two `i32` values: a pointer (offset in linear memory)
and a number of bytes. There are three supported string encodings in [`canonopt`]:
[UTF-8], [UTF-16] and `latin1+utf16`. This last options allows a *dynamic*
choice between [Latin-1] and UTF-16, indicated by the high bit of the second
`i32`. String values include their original encoding and byte length as a
"hint" that enables `store_string` (defined below) to make better up-front
allocation size choices in many cases. Thus, the value produced by
`load_string` isn't simply a Python `str`, but a *tuple* containing a `str`,
the original encoding and the original byte length.
```python
def load_string(cx, ptr):
  begin = load_int(cx, ptr, 4)
  tagged_code_units = load_int(cx, ptr + 4, 4)
  return load_string_from_range(cx, begin, tagged_code_units)

UTF16_TAG = 1 << 31

def load_string_from_range(cx, ptr, tagged_code_units):
  match cx.opts.string_encoding:
    case 'utf8':
      alignment = 1
      byte_length = tagged_code_units
      encoding = 'utf-8'
    case 'utf16':
      alignment = 2
      byte_length = 2 * tagged_code_units
      encoding = 'utf-16-le'
    case 'latin1+utf16':
      alignment = 2
      if bool(tagged_code_units & UTF16_TAG):
        byte_length = 2 * (tagged_code_units ^ UTF16_TAG)
        encoding = 'utf-16-le'
      else:
        byte_length = tagged_code_units
        encoding = 'latin-1'

  trap_if(ptr != align_to(ptr, alignment))
  trap_if(ptr + byte_length > len(cx.opts.memory))
  try:
    s = cx.opts.memory[ptr : ptr+byte_length].decode(encoding)
  except UnicodeError:
    trap()

  return (s, cx.opts.string_encoding, tagged_code_units)
```

Lists and records are loaded by recursively loading their elements/fields:
```python
def load_list(cx, ptr, elem_type):
  begin = load_int(cx, ptr, 4)
  length = load_int(cx, ptr + 4, 4)
  return load_list_from_range(cx, begin, length, elem_type)

def load_list_from_range(cx, ptr, length, elem_type):
  trap_if(ptr != align_to(ptr, alignment(elem_type)))
  trap_if(ptr + length * elem_size(elem_type) > len(cx.opts.memory))
  a = []
  for i in range(length):
    a.append(load(cx, ptr + i * elem_size(elem_type), elem_type))
  return a

def load_record(cx, ptr, fields):
  record = {}
  for field in fields:
    ptr = align_to(ptr, alignment(field.t))
    record[field.label] = load(cx, ptr, field.t)
    ptr += elem_size(field.t)
  return record
```
As a technical detail: the `align_to` in the loop in `load_record` is
guaranteed to be a no-op on the first iteration because the record as
a whole starts out aligned (as asserted at the top of `load`).

Variants are loaded using the order of the cases in the type to determine the
case index, assigning `0` to the first case, `1` to the next case, etc. To
support the subtyping allowed by `refines`, a lifted variant value semantically
includes a full ordered list of its `refines` case labels so that the lowering
code (defined below) can search this list to find a case label it knows about.
While the code below appears to perform case-label lookup at runtime, a normal
implementation can build the appropriate index tables at compile-time so that
variant-passing is always O(1) and not involving string operations.
```python
def load_variant(cx, ptr, cases):
  disc_size = elem_size(discriminant_type(cases))
  case_index = load_int(cx, ptr, disc_size)
  ptr += disc_size
  trap_if(case_index >= len(cases))
  c = cases[case_index]
  ptr = align_to(ptr, max_case_alignment(cases))
  case_label = case_label_with_refinements(c, cases)
  if c.t is None:
    return { case_label: None }
  return { case_label: load(cx, ptr, c.t) }

def case_label_with_refinements(c, cases):
  label = c.label
  while c.refines is not None:
    c = cases[find_case(c.refines, cases)]
    label += '|' + c.label
  return label

def find_case(label, cases):
  matches = [i for i,c in enumerate(cases) if c.label == label]
  assert(len(matches) <= 1)
  if len(matches) == 1:
    return matches[0]
  return -1
```

Flags are converted from a bit-vector to a dictionary whose keys are
derived from the ordered labels of the `flags` type. The code here takes
advantage of Python's support for integers of arbitrary width.
```python
def load_flags(cx, ptr, labels):
  i = load_int(cx, ptr, elem_size_flags(labels))
  return unpack_flags_from_int(i, labels)

def unpack_flags_from_int(i, labels):
  record = {}
  for l in labels:
    record[l] = bool(i & 1)
    i >>= 1
  return record
```

`own` handles are lifted by removing the handle from the current component
instance's handle table, so that ownership is *transferred* to the lowering
component. The lifting operation fails if unique ownership of the handle isn't
possible, for example if the index was actually a `borrow` or if the `own`
handle is currently being lent out as borrows.
```python
def lift_own(cx, i, t):
  h = cx.inst.handles.remove(t.rt, i)
  trap_if(h.lend_count != 0)
  trap_if(not h.own)
  return h.rep
```
The abstract lifted value for handle types is currently just the internal
resource representation `i32`, which is kept opaque from the receiving
component (it's stored in the handle table and only accessed indirectly via
index). (This assumes that resource representations are immutable. If
representations were to become mutable, the address of the mutable cell would
be passed as the lifted value instead.)

In contrast to `own`, `borrow` handles are lifted by reading the representation
from the source handle, leaving the source handle intact in the current
component instance's handle table:
```python
def lift_borrow(cx, i, t):
  assert(isinstance(cx, ImportCall))
  h = cx.inst.handles.get(t.rt, i)
  if h.own:
    cx.track_owning_lend(h)
  return h.rep
```
The `track_owning_lend` call to `CallContext` participates in the enforcement
of the dynamic borrow rules, which keep the source `own` handle alive until the
end of the call (as an intentionally-conservative upper bound on how long the
`borrow` handle can be held). This tracking is only required when `h` is an
`own` handle because, when `h` is a `borrow` handle, this tracking has already
happened (when the originating `own` handle was lifted) for a strictly longer
call scope than the current call.


### Storing

The `store` function defines how to write a value `v` of a given value type
`t` into linear memory starting at offset `ptr`. Presenting the definition of
`store` piecewise, we start with the top-level case analysis:
```python
def store(cx, v, t, ptr):
  assert(ptr == align_to(ptr, alignment(t)))
  assert(ptr + elem_size(t) <= len(cx.opts.memory))
  match despecialize(t):
    case Bool()         : store_int(cx, int(bool(v)), ptr, 1)
    case U8()           : store_int(cx, v, ptr, 1)
    case U16()          : store_int(cx, v, ptr, 2)
    case U32()          : store_int(cx, v, ptr, 4)
    case U64()          : store_int(cx, v, ptr, 8)
    case S8()           : store_int(cx, v, ptr, 1, signed=True)
    case S16()          : store_int(cx, v, ptr, 2, signed=True)
    case S32()          : store_int(cx, v, ptr, 4, signed=True)
    case S64()          : store_int(cx, v, ptr, 8, signed=True)
    case F32()          : store_int(cx, encode_float_as_i32(v), ptr, 4)
    case F64()          : store_int(cx, encode_float_as_i64(v), ptr, 8)
    case Char()         : store_int(cx, char_to_i32(v), ptr, 4)
    case String()       : store_string(cx, v, ptr)
    case List(t)        : store_list(cx, v, ptr, t)
    case Record(fields) : store_record(cx, v, ptr, fields)
    case Variant(cases) : store_variant(cx, v, ptr, cases)
    case Flags(labels)  : store_flags(cx, v, ptr, labels)
    case Own()          : store_int(cx, lower_own(cx.opts, v, t), ptr, 4)
    case Borrow()       : store_int(cx, lower_borrow(cx.opts, v, t), ptr, 4)
```

Integers are stored directly into memory. Because the input domain is exactly
the integers in range for the given type, no extra range checks are necessary;
the `signed` parameter is only present to ensure that the internal range checks
of `int.to_bytes` are satisfied.
```python
def store_int(cx, v, ptr, nbytes, signed = False):
  cx.opts.memory[ptr : ptr+nbytes] = int.to_bytes(v, nbytes, 'little', signed=signed)
```

Floats are stored directly into memory, with the sign and payload bits of NaN
values modified non-deterministically. This reflects the practical reality that
different languages, protocols and CPUs have different effects on NaNs.

Although this non-determinism is expressed in the Python code below as
generating a "random" NaN bit-pattern, native implementations do not need to
use the same "random" algorithm, or even any random algorithm at all. Hosts
may instead chose to canonicalize to an arbitrary fixed NaN value, or even to
the original value of the NaN before lifting, allowing them to optimize away
both the canonicalization of lifting and the randomization of lowering.

When a host implements the [deterministic profile], NaNs are canonicalized to
a particular NaN bit-pattern.
```python
def maybe_scramble_nan32(f):
  if math.isnan(f):
    if DETERMINISTIC_PROFILE:
      f = core_f32_reinterpret_i32(CANONICAL_FLOAT32_NAN)
    else:
      f = core_f32_reinterpret_i32(random_nan_bits(32, 8))
    assert(math.isnan(f))
  return f

def maybe_scramble_nan64(f):
  if math.isnan(f):
    if DETERMINISTIC_PROFILE:
      f = core_f64_reinterpret_i64(CANONICAL_FLOAT64_NAN)
    else:
      f = core_f64_reinterpret_i64(random_nan_bits(64, 11))
    assert(math.isnan(f))
  return f

def random_nan_bits(total_bits, exponent_bits):
  fraction_bits = total_bits - exponent_bits - 1
  bits = random.getrandbits(total_bits)
  bits |= ((1 << exponent_bits) - 1) << fraction_bits
  bits |= 1 << random.randrange(fraction_bits - 1)
  return bits

def encode_float_as_i32(f):
  return core_i32_reinterpret_f32(maybe_scramble_nan32(f))

def encode_float_as_i64(f):
  return core_i64_reinterpret_f64(maybe_scramble_nan64(f))

def core_i32_reinterpret_f32(f):
  return struct.unpack('<I', struct.pack('<f', f))[0] # i32.reinterpret_f32

def core_i64_reinterpret_f64(f):
  return struct.unpack('<Q', struct.pack('<d', f))[0] # i64.reinterpret_f64
```

The integral value of a `char` (a [Unicode Scalar Value]) is a valid unsigned
`i32` and thus no runtime conversion or checking is necessary:
```python
def char_to_i32(c):
  i = ord(c)
  assert(0 <= i <= 0xD7FF or 0xD800 <= i <= 0x10FFFF)
  return i
```

Storing strings is complicated by the goal of attempting to optimize the
different transcoding cases. In particular, one challenge is choosing the
linear memory allocation size *before* examining the contents of the string.
The reason for this constraint is that, in some settings where single-pass
iterators are involved (host calls and post-MVP [adapter functions]), examining
the contents of a string more than once would require making an engine-internal
temporary copy of the whole string, which the component model specifically aims
not to do. To avoid multiple passes, the canonical ABI instead uses a `realloc`
approach to update the allocation size during the single copy. A blind
`realloc` approach would normally suffer from multiple reallocations per string
(e.g., using the standard doubling-growth strategy). However, as already shown
in `load_string` above, string values come with two useful hints: their
original encoding and byte length. From this hint data, `store_string` can do a
much better job minimizing the number of reallocations.

We start with a case analysis to enumerate all the meaningful encoding
combinations, subdividing the `latin1+utf16` encoding into either `latin1` or
`utf16` based on the `UTF16_BIT` flag set by `load_string`:
```python
def store_string(cx, v, ptr):
  begin, tagged_code_units = store_string_into_range(cx, v)
  store_int(cx, begin, ptr, 4)
  store_int(cx, tagged_code_units, ptr + 4, 4)

def store_string_into_range(cx, v):
  src, src_encoding, src_tagged_code_units = v

  if src_encoding == 'latin1+utf16':
    if bool(src_tagged_code_units & UTF16_TAG):
      src_simple_encoding = 'utf16'
      src_code_units = src_tagged_code_units ^ UTF16_TAG
    else:
      src_simple_encoding = 'latin1'
      src_code_units = src_tagged_code_units
  else:
    src_simple_encoding = src_encoding
    src_code_units = src_tagged_code_units

  match cx.opts.string_encoding:
    case 'utf8':
      match src_simple_encoding:
        case 'utf8'         : return store_string_copy(cx, src, src_code_units, 1, 1, 'utf-8')
        case 'utf16'        : return store_utf16_to_utf8(cx, src, src_code_units)
        case 'latin1'       : return store_latin1_to_utf8(cx, src, src_code_units)
    case 'utf16':
      match src_simple_encoding:
        case 'utf8'         : return store_utf8_to_utf16(cx, src, src_code_units)
        case 'utf16'        : return store_string_copy(cx, src, src_code_units, 2, 2, 'utf-16-le')
        case 'latin1'       : return store_string_copy(cx, src, src_code_units, 2, 2, 'utf-16-le')
    case 'latin1+utf16':
      match src_encoding:
        case 'utf8'         : return store_string_to_latin1_or_utf16(cx, src, src_code_units)
        case 'utf16'        : return store_string_to_latin1_or_utf16(cx, src, src_code_units)
        case 'latin1+utf16' :
          match src_simple_encoding:
            case 'latin1'   : return store_string_copy(cx, src, src_code_units, 1, 2, 'latin-1')
            case 'utf16'    : return store_probably_utf16_to_latin1_or_utf16(cx, src, src_code_units)
```

The simplest 4 cases above can compute the exact destination size and then copy
with a simply loop (that possibly inflates Latin-1 to UTF-16 by injecting a 0
byte after every Latin-1 byte).
```python
MAX_STRING_BYTE_LENGTH = (1 << 31) - 1

def store_string_copy(cx, src, src_code_units, dst_code_unit_size, dst_alignment, dst_encoding):
  dst_byte_length = dst_code_unit_size * src_code_units
  trap_if(dst_byte_length > MAX_STRING_BYTE_LENGTH)
  ptr = cx.opts.realloc(0, 0, dst_alignment, dst_byte_length)
  trap_if(ptr != align_to(ptr, dst_alignment))
  trap_if(ptr + dst_byte_length > len(cx.opts.memory))
  encoded = src.encode(dst_encoding)
  assert(dst_byte_length == len(encoded))
  cx.opts.memory[ptr : ptr+len(encoded)] = encoded
  return (ptr, src_code_units)
```
The choice of `MAX_STRING_BYTE_LENGTH` constant ensures that the high bit of a
string's byte length is never set, keeping it clear for `UTF16_BIT`.

The 2 cases of transcoding into UTF-8 share an algorithm that starts by
optimistically assuming that each code unit of the source string fits in a
single UTF-8 byte and then, failing that, reallocates to a worst-case size,
finishes the copy, and then finishes with a shrinking reallocation.
```python
def store_utf16_to_utf8(cx, src, src_code_units):
  worst_case_size = src_code_units * 3
  return store_string_to_utf8(cx, src, src_code_units, worst_case_size)

def store_latin1_to_utf8(cx, src, src_code_units):
  worst_case_size = src_code_units * 2
  return store_string_to_utf8(cx, src, src_code_units, worst_case_size)

def store_string_to_utf8(cx, src, src_code_units, worst_case_size):
  assert(src_code_units <= MAX_STRING_BYTE_LENGTH)
  ptr = cx.opts.realloc(0, 0, 1, src_code_units)
  trap_if(ptr + src_code_units > len(cx.opts.memory))
  for i,code_point in enumerate(src):
    if ord(code_point) < 2**7:
      cx.opts.memory[ptr + i] = ord(code_point)
    else:
      trap_if(worst_case_size > MAX_STRING_BYTE_LENGTH)
      ptr = cx.opts.realloc(ptr, src_code_units, 1, worst_case_size)
      trap_if(ptr + worst_case_size > len(cx.opts.memory))
      encoded = src.encode('utf-8')
      cx.opts.memory[ptr+i : ptr+len(encoded)] = encoded[i : ]
      if worst_case_size > len(encoded):
        ptr = cx.opts.realloc(ptr, worst_case_size, 1, len(encoded))
        trap_if(ptr + len(encoded) > len(cx.opts.memory))
      return (ptr, len(encoded))
  return (ptr, src_code_units)
```

Converting from UTF-8 to UTF-16 performs an initial worst-case size allocation
(assuming each UTF-8 byte encodes a whole code point that inflates into a
two-byte UTF-16 code unit) and then does a shrinking reallocation at the end
if multiple UTF-8 bytes were collapsed into a single 2-byte UTF-16 code unit:
```python
def store_utf8_to_utf16(cx, src, src_code_units):
  worst_case_size = 2 * src_code_units
  trap_if(worst_case_size > MAX_STRING_BYTE_LENGTH)
  ptr = cx.opts.realloc(0, 0, 2, worst_case_size)
  trap_if(ptr != align_to(ptr, 2))
  trap_if(ptr + worst_case_size > len(cx.opts.memory))
  encoded = src.encode('utf-16-le')
  cx.opts.memory[ptr : ptr+len(encoded)] = encoded
  if len(encoded) < worst_case_size:
    ptr = cx.opts.realloc(ptr, worst_case_size, 2, len(encoded))
    trap_if(ptr != align_to(ptr, 2))
    trap_if(ptr + len(encoded) > len(cx.opts.memory))
  code_units = int(len(encoded) / 2)
  return (ptr, code_units)
```

The next transcoding case handles `latin1+utf16` encoding, where there general
goal is to fit the incoming string into Latin-1 if possible based on the code
points of the incoming string. The algorithm speculates that all code points
*do* fit into Latin-1 and then falls back to a worst-case allocation size when
a code point is found outside Latin-1. In this fallback case, the
previously-copied Latin-1 bytes are inflated *in place*, inserting a 0 byte
after every Latin-1 byte (iterating in reverse to avoid clobbering later
bytes):
```python
def store_string_to_latin1_or_utf16(cx, src, src_code_units):
  assert(src_code_units <= MAX_STRING_BYTE_LENGTH)
  ptr = cx.opts.realloc(0, 0, 2, src_code_units)
  trap_if(ptr != align_to(ptr, 2))
  trap_if(ptr + src_code_units > len(cx.opts.memory))
  dst_byte_length = 0
  for usv in src:
    if ord(usv) < (1 << 8):
      cx.opts.memory[ptr + dst_byte_length] = ord(usv)
      dst_byte_length += 1
    else:
      worst_case_size = 2 * src_code_units
      trap_if(worst_case_size > MAX_STRING_BYTE_LENGTH)
      ptr = cx.opts.realloc(ptr, src_code_units, 2, worst_case_size)
      trap_if(ptr != align_to(ptr, 2))
      trap_if(ptr + worst_case_size > len(cx.opts.memory))
      for j in range(dst_byte_length-1, -1, -1):
        cx.opts.memory[ptr + 2*j] = cx.opts.memory[ptr + j]
        cx.opts.memory[ptr + 2*j + 1] = 0
      encoded = src.encode('utf-16-le')
      cx.opts.memory[ptr+2*dst_byte_length : ptr+len(encoded)] = encoded[2*dst_byte_length : ]
      if worst_case_size > len(encoded):
        ptr = cx.opts.realloc(ptr, worst_case_size, 2, len(encoded))
        trap_if(ptr != align_to(ptr, 2))
        trap_if(ptr + len(encoded) > len(cx.opts.memory))
      tagged_code_units = int(len(encoded) / 2) | UTF16_TAG
      return (ptr, tagged_code_units)
  if dst_byte_length < src_code_units:
    ptr = cx.opts.realloc(ptr, src_code_units, 2, dst_byte_length)
    trap_if(ptr != align_to(ptr, 2))
    trap_if(ptr + dst_byte_length > len(cx.opts.memory))
  return (ptr, dst_byte_length)
```

The final transcoding case takes advantage of the extra heuristic
information that the incoming UTF-16 bytes were intentionally chosen over
Latin-1 by the producer, indicating that they *probably* contain code points
outside Latin-1 and thus *probably* require inflation. Based on this
information, the transcoding algorithm pessimistically allocates storage for
UTF-16, deflating at the end if indeed no non-Latin-1 code points were
encountered. This Latin-1 deflation ensures that if a group of components
are all using `latin1+utf16` and *one* component over-uses UTF-16, other
components can recover the Latin-1 compression. (The Latin-1 check can be
inexpensively fused with the UTF-16 validate+copy loop.)
```python
def store_probably_utf16_to_latin1_or_utf16(cx, src, src_code_units):
  src_byte_length = 2 * src_code_units
  trap_if(src_byte_length > MAX_STRING_BYTE_LENGTH)
  ptr = cx.opts.realloc(0, 0, 2, src_byte_length)
  trap_if(ptr != align_to(ptr, 2))
  trap_if(ptr + src_byte_length > len(cx.opts.memory))
  encoded = src.encode('utf-16-le')
  cx.opts.memory[ptr : ptr+len(encoded)] = encoded
  if any(ord(c) >= (1 << 8) for c in src):
    tagged_code_units = int(len(encoded) / 2) | UTF16_TAG
    return (ptr, tagged_code_units)
  latin1_size = int(len(encoded) / 2)
  for i in range(latin1_size):
    cx.opts.memory[ptr + i] = cx.opts.memory[ptr + 2*i]
  ptr = cx.opts.realloc(ptr, src_byte_length, 1, latin1_size)
  trap_if(ptr + latin1_size > len(cx.opts.memory))
  return (ptr, latin1_size)
```

Lists and records are stored by recursively storing their elements and
are symmetric to the loading functions. Unlike strings, lists can
simply allocate based on the up-front knowledge of length and static
element size.
```python
def store_list(cx, v, ptr, elem_type):
  begin, length = store_list_into_range(cx, v, elem_type)
  store_int(cx, begin, ptr, 4)
  store_int(cx, length, ptr + 4, 4)

def store_list_into_range(cx, v, elem_type):
  byte_length = len(v) * elem_size(elem_type)
  trap_if(byte_length >= (1 << 32))
  ptr = cx.opts.realloc(0, 0, alignment(elem_type), byte_length)
  trap_if(ptr != align_to(ptr, alignment(elem_type)))
  trap_if(ptr + byte_length > len(cx.opts.memory))
  for i,e in enumerate(v):
    store(cx, e, elem_type, ptr + i * elem_size(elem_type))
  return (ptr, len(v))

def store_record(cx, v, ptr, fields):
  for f in fields:
    ptr = align_to(ptr, alignment(f.t))
    store(cx, v[f.label], f.t, ptr)
    ptr += elem_size(f.t)
```

Variants are stored using the `|`-separated list of `refines` cases built
by `case_label_with_refinements` (above) to iteratively find a matching case (which
validation guarantees will succeed). While this code appears to do O(n) string
matching, a normal implementation can statically fuse `store_variant` with its
matching `load_variant` to ultimately build a dense array that maps producer's
case indices to the consumer's case indices.
```python
def store_variant(cx, v, ptr, cases):
  case_index, case_value = match_case(v, cases)
  disc_size = elem_size(discriminant_type(cases))
  store_int(cx, case_index, ptr, disc_size)
  ptr += disc_size
  ptr = align_to(ptr, max_case_alignment(cases))
  c = cases[case_index]
  if c.t is not None:
    store(cx, case_value, c.t, ptr)

def match_case(v, cases):
  assert(len(v.keys()) == 1)
  key = list(v.keys())[0]
  value = list(v.values())[0]
  for label in key.split('|'):
    case_index = find_case(label, cases)
    if case_index != -1:
      return (case_index, value)
```

Flags are converted from a dictionary to a bit-vector by iterating
through the case-labels of the variant in the order they were listed in the
type definition and OR-ing all the bits together. Flag lifting/lowering can be
statically fused into array/integer operations (with a simple byte copy when
the case lists are the same) to avoid any string operations in a similar manner
to variants.
```python
def store_flags(cx, v, ptr, labels):
  i = pack_flags_into_int(v, labels)
  store_int(cx, i, ptr, elem_size_flags(labels))

def pack_flags_into_int(v, labels):
  i = 0
  shift = 0
  for l in labels:
    i |= (int(bool(v[l])) << shift)
    shift += 1
  return i
```

Finally, `own` and `borrow` handles are lowered by initializing new handle
elements in the current component instance's handle table:
```python
def lower_own(cx, rep, t):
  h = HandleElem(rep, own=True)
  return cx.inst.handles.add(t.rt, h)

def lower_borrow(cx, rep, t):
  assert(isinstance(cx, ExportCall))
  if cx.inst is t.rt.impl:
    return rep
  h = HandleElem(rep, own=False, scope=cx)
  cx.create_borrow()
  return cx.inst.handles.add(t.rt, h)
```
The special case in `lower_borrow` is an optimization, recognizing that, when
a borrowed handle is passed to the component that implemented the resource
type, the only thing the borrowed handle is good for is calling
`resource.rep`, so lowering might as well avoid the overhead of creating an
intermediate borrow handle.

### Flattening

With only the definitions above, the Canonical ABI would be forced to place all
parameters and results in linear memory. While this is necessary in the general
case, in many cases performance can be improved by passing small-enough values
in registers by using core function parameters and results. To support this
optimization, the Canonical ABI defines `flatten` to map component function
types to core function types by attempting to decompose all the
non-dynamically-sized component value types into core value types.

For a variety of [practical][Implementation Limits] reasons, we need to limit
the total number of flattened parameters and results, falling back to storing
everything in linear memory. The number of flattened results is currently
limited to 1 due to various parts of the toolchain (notably the C ABI) not yet
being able to express [multi-value] returns. Hopefully this limitation is
temporary and can be lifted before the Component Model is fully standardized.

When there are too many flat values, in general, a single `i32` pointer can be
passed instead (pointing to a tuple in linear memory). When lowering *into*
linear memory, this requires the Canonical ABI to call `realloc` (in `lower`
below) to allocate space to put the tuple. As an optimization, when lowering
the return value of an imported function (via `canon lower`), the caller can
have already allocated space for the return value (e.g., efficiently on the
stack), passing in an `i32` pointer as an parameter instead of returning an
`i32` as a return value.

Given all this, the top-level definition of `flatten` is:
```python
MAX_FLAT_PARAMS = 16
MAX_FLAT_RESULTS = 1

def flatten_functype(ft, context):
  flat_params = flatten_types(ft.param_types())
  if len(flat_params) > MAX_FLAT_PARAMS:
    flat_params = ['i32']

  flat_results = flatten_types(ft.result_types())
  if len(flat_results) > MAX_FLAT_RESULTS:
    match context:
      case 'lift':
        flat_results = ['i32']
      case 'lower':
        flat_params += ['i32']
        flat_results = []

  return CoreFuncType(flat_params, flat_results)

def flatten_types(ts):
  return [ft for t in ts for ft in flatten_type(t)]
```

Presenting the definition of `flatten_type` piecewise, we start with the
top-level case analysis:
```python
def flatten_type(t):
  match despecialize(t):
    case Bool()               : return ['i32']
    case U8() | U16() | U32() : return ['i32']
    case S8() | S16() | S32() : return ['i32']
    case S64() | U64()        : return ['i64']
    case F32()                : return ['f32']
    case F64()                : return ['f64']
    case Char()               : return ['i32']
    case String() | List(_)   : return ['i32', 'i32']
    case Record(fields)       : return flatten_record(fields)
    case Variant(cases)       : return flatten_variant(cases)
    case Flags(labels)        : return ['i32'] * num_i32_flags(labels)
    case Own(_) | Borrow(_)   : return ['i32']
```

Record flattening simply flattens each field in sequence.
```python
def flatten_record(fields):
  flat = []
  for f in fields:
    flat += flatten_type(f.t)
  return flat
```

Variant flattening is more involved due to the fact that each case payload can
have a totally different flattening. Rather than giving up when there is a type
mismatch, the Canonical ABI relies on the fact that the 4 core value types can
be easily bit-cast between each other and defines a `join` operator to pick the
tightest approximation. What this means is that, regardless of the dynamic
case, all flattened variants are passed with the same static set of core types,
which may involve, e.g., reinterpreting an `f32` as an `i32` or zero-extending
an `i32` into an `i64`.
```python
def flatten_variant(cases):
  flat = []
  for c in cases:
    if c.t is not None:
      for i,ft in enumerate(flatten_type(c.t)):
        if i < len(flat):
          flat[i] = join(flat[i], ft)
        else:
          flat.append(ft)
  return flatten_type(discriminant_type(cases)) + flat

def join(a, b):
  if a == b: return a
  if (a == 'i32' and b == 'f32') or (a == 'f32' and b == 'i32'): return 'i32'
  return 'i64'
```

### Flat Lifting

Values are lifted by iterating over a list of parameter or result Core
WebAssembly values:
```python
@dataclass
class CoreValueIter:
  values: list[int|float]
  i = 0
  def next(self, t):
    v = self.values[self.i]
    self.i += 1
    match t:
      case 'i32': assert(isinstance(v, int) and 0 <= v < 2**32)
      case 'i64': assert(isinstance(v, int) and 0 <= v < 2**64)
      case 'f32': assert(isinstance(v, (int,float)))
      case 'f64': assert(isinstance(v, (int,float)))
      case _    : assert(False)
    return v
```
The `match` is only used for spec-level assertions; no runtime typecase is
required.

The `lift_flat` function defines how to convert a list of core values into a
single high-level value of type `t`. Presenting the definition of `lift_flat`
piecewise, we start with the top-level case analysis:
```python
def lift_flat(cx, vi, t):
  match despecialize(t):
    case Bool()         : return convert_int_to_bool(vi.next('i32'))
    case U8()           : return lift_flat_unsigned(vi, 32, 8)
    case U16()          : return lift_flat_unsigned(vi, 32, 16)
    case U32()          : return lift_flat_unsigned(vi, 32, 32)
    case U64()          : return lift_flat_unsigned(vi, 64, 64)
    case S8()           : return lift_flat_signed(vi, 32, 8)
    case S16()          : return lift_flat_signed(vi, 32, 16)
    case S32()          : return lift_flat_signed(vi, 32, 32)
    case S64()          : return lift_flat_signed(vi, 64, 64)
    case F32()          : return canonicalize_nan32(vi.next('f32'))
    case F64()          : return canonicalize_nan64(vi.next('f64'))
    case Char()         : return convert_i32_to_char(cx, vi.next('i32'))
    case String()       : return lift_flat_string(cx, vi)
    case List(t)        : return lift_flat_list(cx, vi, t)
    case Record(fields) : return lift_flat_record(cx, vi, fields)
    case Variant(cases) : return lift_flat_variant(cx, vi, cases)
    case Flags(labels)  : return lift_flat_flags(vi, labels)
    case Own()          : return lift_own(cx, vi.next('i32'), t)
    case Borrow()       : return lift_borrow(cx, vi.next('i32'), t)
```

Integers are lifted from core `i32` or `i64` values using the signedness of the
target type to interpret the high-order bit. When the target type is narrower
than an `i32`, the Canonical ABI ignores the unused high bits (like `load_int`).
The conversion logic here assumes that `i32` values are always represented as
unsigned Python `int`s and thus lifting to a signed type performs a manual 2s
complement conversion in the Python (which would be a no-op in hardware).
```python
def lift_flat_unsigned(vi, core_width, t_width):
  i = vi.next('i' + str(core_width))
  assert(0 <= i < (1 << core_width))
  return i % (1 << t_width)

def lift_flat_signed(vi, core_width, t_width):
  i = vi.next('i' + str(core_width))
  assert(0 <= i < (1 << core_width))
  i %= (1 << t_width)
  if i >= (1 << (t_width - 1)):
    return i - (1 << t_width)
  return i
```

The contents of strings and lists are always stored in memory so lifting these
types is essentially the same as loading them from memory; the only difference
is that the pointer and length come from `i32` values instead of from linear
memory:
```python
def lift_flat_string(cx, vi):
  ptr = vi.next('i32')
  packed_length = vi.next('i32')
  return load_string_from_range(cx, ptr, packed_length)

def lift_flat_list(cx, vi, elem_type):
  ptr = vi.next('i32')
  length = vi.next('i32')
  return load_list_from_range(cx, ptr, length, elem_type)
```

Records are lifted by recursively lifting their fields:
```python
def lift_flat_record(cx, vi, fields):
  record = {}
  for f in fields:
    record[f.label] = lift_flat(cx, vi, f.t)
  return record
```

Variants are also lifted recursively. Lifting a variant must carefully follow
the definition of `flatten_variant` above, consuming the exact same core types
regardless of the dynamic case payload being lifted. Because of the `join`
performed by `flatten_variant`, we need a more-permissive value iterator that
reinterprets between the different types appropriately and also traps if the
high bits of an `i64` are set for a 32-bit type:
```python
def lift_flat_variant(cx, vi, cases):
  flat_types = flatten_variant(cases)
  assert(flat_types.pop(0) == 'i32')
  case_index = vi.next('i32')
  trap_if(case_index >= len(cases))
  class CoerceValueIter:
    def next(self, want):
      have = flat_types.pop(0)
      x = vi.next(have)
      match (have, want):
        case ('i32', 'f32') : return decode_i32_as_float(x)
        case ('i64', 'i32') : return wrap_i64_to_i32(x)
        case ('i64', 'f32') : return decode_i32_as_float(wrap_i64_to_i32(x))
        case ('i64', 'f64') : return decode_i64_as_float(x)
        case _              : assert(have == want); return x
  c = cases[case_index]
  if c.t is None:
    v = None
  else:
    v = lift_flat(cx, CoerceValueIter(), c.t)
  for have in flat_types:
    _ = vi.next(have)
  return { case_label_with_refinements(c, cases): v }

def wrap_i64_to_i32(i):
  assert(0 <= i < (1 << 64))
  return i % (1 << 32)
```

Finally, flags are lifted by OR-ing together all the flattened `i32` values
and then lifting to a record the same way as when loading flags from linear
memory.
```python
def lift_flat_flags(vi, labels):
  i = 0
  shift = 0
  for _ in range(num_i32_flags(labels)):
    i |= (vi.next('i32') << shift)
    shift += 32
  return unpack_flags_from_int(i, labels)
```

### Flat Lowering

The `lower_flat` function defines how to convert a value `v` of a given type
`t` into zero or more core values. Presenting the definition of `lower_flat`
piecewise, we start with the top-level case analysis:
```python
def lower_flat(cx, v, t):
  match despecialize(t):
    case Bool()         : return [int(v)]
    case U8()           : return [v]
    case U16()          : return [v]
    case U32()          : return [v]
    case U64()          : return [v]
    case S8()           : return lower_flat_signed(v, 32)
    case S16()          : return lower_flat_signed(v, 32)
    case S32()          : return lower_flat_signed(v, 32)
    case S64()          : return lower_flat_signed(v, 64)
    case F32()          : return [maybe_scramble_nan32(v)]
    case F64()          : return [maybe_scramble_nan64(v)]
    case Char()         : return [char_to_i32(v)]
    case String()       : return lower_flat_string(cx, v)
    case List(t)        : return lower_flat_list(cx, v, t)
    case Record(fields) : return lower_flat_record(cx, v, fields)
    case Variant(cases) : return lower_flat_variant(cx, v, cases)
    case Flags(labels)  : return lower_flat_flags(v, labels)
    case Own()          : return [lower_own(cx, v, t)]
    case Borrow()       : return [lower_borrow(cx, v, t)]
```

Since component-level values are assumed in-range and, as previously stated,
core `i32` values are always internally represented as unsigned `int`s,
unsigned integer values need no extra conversion. Signed integer values are
converted to unsigned core `i32`s by 2s complement arithmetic (which again
would be a no-op in hardware):
```python
def lower_flat_signed(i, core_bits):
  if i < 0:
    i += (1 << core_bits)
  return [i]
```

Since strings and lists are stored in linear memory, lifting can reuse the
previous definitions; only the resulting pointers are returned differently
(as `i32` values instead of as a pair in linear memory):
```python
def lower_flat_string(cx, v):
  ptr, packed_length = store_string_into_range(cx, v)
  return [ptr, packed_length]

def lower_flat_list(cx, v, elem_type):
  (ptr, length) = store_list_into_range(cx, v, elem_type)
  return [ptr, length]
```

Records are lowered by recursively lowering their fields:
```python
def lower_flat_record(cx, v, fields):
  flat = []
  for f in fields:
    flat += lower_flat(cx, v[f.label], f.t)
  return flat
```

Variants are also lowered recursively. Symmetric to `lift_flat_variant` above,
`lower_flat_variant` must consume all flattened types of `flatten_variant`,
manually coercing the otherwise-incompatible type pairings allowed by `join`:
```python
def lower_flat_variant(cx, v, cases):
  case_index, case_value = match_case(v, cases)
  flat_types = flatten_variant(cases)
  assert(flat_types.pop(0) == 'i32')
  c = cases[case_index]
  if c.t is None:
    payload = []
  else:
    payload = lower_flat(cx, case_value, c.t)
    for i,(fv,have) in enumerate(zip(payload, flatten_type(c.t))):
      want = flat_types.pop(0)
      match (have, want):
        case ('f32', 'i32') : payload[i] = encode_float_as_i32(fv)
        case ('i32', 'i64') : payload[i] = fv
        case ('f32', 'i64') : payload[i] = encode_float_as_i32(fv)
        case ('f64', 'i64') : payload[i] = encode_float_as_i64(fv)
        case _              : assert(have == want)
  for _ in flat_types:
    payload.append(0)
  return [case_index] + payload
```

Finally, flags are lowered by slicing the bit vector into `i32` chunks:
```python
def lower_flat_flags(v, labels):
  i = pack_flags_into_int(v, labels)
  flat = []
  for _ in range(num_i32_flags(labels)):
    flat.append(i & 0xffffffff)
    i >>= 32
  assert(i == 0)
  return flat
```

### Lifting and Lowering Values

The `lift_values` function defines how to lift a list of at most `max_flat`
core parameters or results given by the `CoreValueIter` `vi` into a tuple of
values with types `ts`:
```python
def lift_values(cx, max_flat, vi, ts):
  flat_types = flatten_types(ts)
  if len(flat_types) > max_flat:
    ptr = vi.next('i32')
    tuple_type = Tuple(ts)
    trap_if(ptr != align_to(ptr, alignment(tuple_type)))
    trap_if(ptr + elem_size(tuple_type) > len(cx.opts.memory))
    return list(load(cx, ptr, tuple_type).values())
  else:
    return [ lift_flat(cx, vi, t) for t in ts ]
```

The `lower_values` function defines how to lower a list of component-level
values `vs` of types `ts` into a list of at most `max_flat` core values. As
already described for [`flatten`](#flattening) above, lowering handles the
greater-than-`max_flat` case by either allocating storage with `realloc` or
accepting a caller-allocated buffer as an out-param:
```python
def lower_values(cx, max_flat, vs, ts, out_param = None):
  inst = cx.inst
  assert(inst.may_leave)
  inst.may_leave = False

  flat_types = flatten_types(ts)
  if len(flat_types) > max_flat:
    tuple_type = Tuple(ts)
    tuple_value = {str(i): v for i,v in enumerate(vs)}
    if out_param is None:
      ptr = cx.opts.realloc(0, 0, alignment(tuple_type), elem_size(tuple_type))
    else:
      ptr = out_param.next('i32')
    trap_if(ptr != align_to(ptr, alignment(tuple_type)))
    trap_if(ptr + elem_size(tuple_type) > len(cx.opts.memory))
    store(cx, tuple_value, tuple_type, ptr)
    flat_vales = [ptr]
  else:
    flat_vals = []
    for i in range(len(vs)):
      flat_vals += lower_flat(cx, vs[i], ts[i])

  inst.may_leave = True
  return flat_vals
```
The `may_leave` flag is used by `canon_lower` below to prevent a component from
calling out of the component while in the middle of lowering, ensuring that the
relative ordering of the side effects of `lift_values` and `lower_values`
cannot be observed and thus an implementation may reliably fuse `lift_values`
with `lower_values` when making a cross-component call, avoiding any
intermediate copy.

## Canonical Definitions

Using the above supporting definitions, we can describe the static and dynamic
semantics of component-level [`canon`] definitions. The following subsections
cover each of these `canon` cases.

### `canon lift`

For a canonical definition:
```wasm
(canon lift $callee:<funcidx> $opts:<canonopt>* (func $f (type $ft)))
```
validation specifies:
* `$callee` must have type `flatten_functype($ft, 'lift')`
* `$f` is given type `$ft`
* a `memory` is present if required by lifting and is a subtype of `(memory 1)`
* a `realloc` is present if required by lifting and has type `(func (param i32 i32 i32 i32) (result i32))`
* if a `post-return` is present, it has type `(func (param flatten_functype($ft).results))`

When instantiating component instance `$inst`:
* Define `$f` to be the partially-bound closure `canon_lift($opts, $inst, $callee, $ft)`

Thus, `$f` captures `$opts`, `$inst`, `$callee` and `$ft` in a closure which
can be subsequently exported or passed into a child instance (via `with`). If
`$f` ends up being called by the host, the host is responsible for, in a
host-defined manner, conjuring up component values suitable for passing into
`lower` and, conversely, consuming the component values produced by `lift`. For
example, if the host is a native JS runtime, the [JavaScript embedding] would
specify how native JavaScript values are converted to and from component
values. Alternatively, if the host is a Unix CLI that invokes component exports
directly from the command line, the CLI could choose to automatically parse
`argv` into component-level values according to the declared types of the
export. In any case, `canon lift` specifies how these variously-produced values
are consumed as parameters (and produced as results) by a *single host-agnostic
component*.

Given the above closure arguments, `canon_lift` is defined:
```python
def canon_lift(opts, inst, callee, ft, start_thunk, return_thunk):
  export_call = ExportCall(opts, inst)
  trap_if(not inst.may_enter)

  flat_args = lower_values(export_call, MAX_FLAT_PARAMS, start_thunk(), ft.param_types())
  flat_results = call_and_trap_on_throw(callee, flat_args)
  return_thunk(lift_values(export_call, MAX_FLAT_RESULTS, CoreValueIter(flat_results), ft.result_types()))

  if opts.post_return is not None:
    call_and_trap_on_throw(opts.post_return, flat_results)

  export_call.exit()

def call_and_trap_on_throw(callee, args):
  try:
    return callee(args)
  except CoreWebAssemblyException:
    trap()
```
Uncaught Core WebAssembly [exceptions] result in a trap at component
boundaries. Thus, if a component wishes to signal an error, it must use some
sort of explicit type such as `result` (whose `error` case particular language
bindings may choose to map to and from exceptions).

The `start_thunk` and `return_thunk` are used to model the interleaving of
reading arguments out of the caller's stack and memory and writing results
back into the caller's stack and memory. After the results have been copied
from the callee's memory into the caller's memory, the callee's `post_return`
function is called to allow the callee to reclaim any memory.


### `canon lower`

For a canonical definition:
```wasm
(canon lower $callee:<funcidx> $opts:<canonopt>* (core func $f))
```
where `$callee` has type `$ft`, validation specifies:
* `$f` is given type `flatten_functype($ft, 'lower')`
* a `memory` is present if required by lifting and is a subtype of `(memory 1)`
* a `realloc` is present if required by lifting and has type `(func (param i32 i32 i32 i32) (result i32))`
* there is no `post-return` in `$opts`

When instantiating component instance `$inst`:
* Define `$f` to be the partially-bound closure: `canon_lower($opts, $inst, $callee, $ft)`

where `canon_lower` is defined:
```python
def canon_lower(opts, inst, callee, calling_import, ft, flat_args):
  import_call = ImportCall(opts, inst)
  trap_if(not inst.may_leave)

  assert(inst.may_enter)
  if calling_import:
    inst.may_enter = False

  flat_args = CoreValueIter(flat_args)
  flat_results = None

  def start_thunk():
    return lift_values(import_call, MAX_FLAT_PARAMS, flat_args, ft.param_types())

  def return_thunk(results):
    nonlocal flat_results
    flat_results = lower_values(import_call, MAX_FLAT_RESULTS, results, ft.result_types(), flat_args)

  callee(start_thunk, return_thunk)

  if calling_import:
    inst.may_enter = True

  import_call.exit()
  return flat_results
```
Since any cross-component call necessarily transits through a statically-known
`canon_lower`+`canon_lift` call pair, an AOT compiler can fuse `canon_lift` and
`canon_lower` into a single, efficient trampoline. In the future this may allow
efficient compilation of permissive subtyping between components (including the
elimination of string operations on the labels of records and variants) as well
as post-MVP [adapter functions].

By clearing `may_enter` for the duration of calls to imports, the `may_enter`
guard in `canon_lift` ensures that components cannot be externally reentered,
which is part of the [component invariants]. The `calling_import` condition
allows a parent component to call into a child component (which is, by
definition, not a call to an import) and for the child to then reenter the
parent through a function the parent explicitly supplied to the child's
`instantiate`. This form of internal reentrance allows the parent to fully
virtualize the child's imports.

Because `may_enter` is not cleared on the exceptional exit path taken by
`trap()`, if there is a trap during Core WebAssembly execution of lifting or
lowering, the component is left permanently un-enterable, ensuring the
lockdown-after-trap [component invariant].

### `canon resource.new`

For a canonical definition:
```wasm
(canon resource.new $rt (core func $f))
```
validation specifies:
* `$rt` must refer to locally-defined (not imported) resource type
* `$f` is given type `(func (param $rt.rep) (result i32))`, where `$rt.rep` is
  currently fixed to be `i32`.

Calling `$f` invokes the following function, which adds an owning handle
containing the given resource representation in the current component
instance's handle table:
```python
def canon_resource_new(inst, rt, rep):
  h = HandleElem(rep, own=True)
  i = inst.handles.add(rt, h)
  return [i]
```

### `canon resource.drop`

For a canonical definition:
```wasm
(canon resource.drop $rt (core func $f))
```
validation specifies:
* `$rt` must refer to resource type
* `$f` is given type `(func (param i32))`

Calling `$f` invokes the following function, which removes the handle from the
current component instance's handle table and, if the handle was owning, calls
the resource's destructor.
```python
def canon_resource_drop(inst, rt, i):
  h = inst.handles.remove(rt, i)
  if h.own:
    assert(h.scope is None)
    trap_if(h.lend_count != 0)
    trap_if(inst is not rt.impl and not rt.impl.may_enter)
    if rt.dtor:
      rt.dtor(h.rep)
  else:
    h.scope.drop_borrow()
  return []
```
The `may_enter` guard ensures the non-reentrance [component invariant], since
a destructor call is analogous to a call to an export.

### `canon resource.rep`

For a canonical definition:
```wasm
(canon resource.rep $rt (core func $f))
```
validation specifies:
* `$rt` must refer to a locally-defined (not imported) resource type
* `$f` is given type `(func (param i32) (result $rt.rep))`, where `$rt.rep` is
  currently fixed to be `i32`.

Calling `$f` invokes the following function, which extracts the resource
representation from the handle.
```python
def canon_resource_rep(inst, rt, i):
  h = inst.handles.get(rt, i)
  return [h.rep]
```
Note that the "locally-defined" requirement above ensures that only the
component instance defining a resource can access its representation.

### 🧵 `canon thread.spawn`

For a canonical definition:
```wasm
(canon thread.spawn (type $ft) (core func $st))
```
validation specifies:
* `$ft` must refer to a `shared` function type; initially, only the type `(func
  shared (param $c i32))` is allowed (see explanation below)
* `$st` is given type `(func (param $f (ref null $ft)) (param $c i32) (result $e
  i32))`.

> Note: ideally, a thread could be spawned with [arbitrary thread parameters].
> Currently, that would require additional work in the toolchain to support so,
> for simplicity, the current proposal simply fixes a single `i32` parameter type.

Calling `$st` checks that the reference `$f` is not null. Then, it spawns a
thread which:
  - invokes `$f` with `$c`
  - executes `$f` until completion or trap in a `shared` context as described by
    the [shared-everything threads] proposal.

In pseudocode, `$st` looks like:

```python
def canon_thread_spawn(f, c):
  trap_if(f is None)
  if DETERMINISTIC_PROFILE:
    return [-1]

  def thread_start():
    try:
      f(c)
    except CoreWebAssemblyException:
      trap()

  if spawn(thread_start):
    return [0]
  else:
    return [-1]
```

### 🧵 `canon thread.hw_concurrency`

For a canonical definition:
```wasm
(canon thread.hw_concurrency (core func $f))
```
validation specifies:
* `$f` is given type `(func shared (result i32))`.

Calling `$f` returns the number of threads the underlying hardware can be
expected to execute concurrently. This value can be artificially limited by
engine configuration and is not allowed to change over the lifetime of a
component instance.

```python
def canon_thread_hw_concurrency():
  if DETERMINISTIC_PROFILE:
    return [1]
  else:
    return [NUM_ALLOWED_THREADS]
```
